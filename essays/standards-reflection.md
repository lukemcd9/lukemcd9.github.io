## Best Practice

After working with ESLint for a week, I've come to find that coding standards are great and everyone should try to adopt a standard even if it's not ESLint. Having a standard allows everyone's code to look similar and forces software engineers to use the best practice for the language. For example, with ESLint if you define a variable with ***let*** that is never reassigned ESLint tells you that it should be a ***const*** which is pretty useful so the variable isn't accidentally reassigned later which could cause something unexpected to happen in the program.

## Working In Teams

Standards help significantly when working with a group of software engineers on a project. Since everyone has their own style of coding, forcing a standard allows everyone to be able to read someone elses code without having to figure out someone else's style of coding. Currently the projects I work on have a standard that we have to follow, and we have to make sure before committing that the code is formatted to the standard.

Overall, I think ESLint is a great standard to follow. Even though at times some of it's warnings are tedious, it's for the greater good. Using ESLint allows me to learn the *best* practice which hopefully I'll eventually write by default and I won't need to rely on ESLint as much.
