Ever since I've started learning web development, CSS has always been the bane of my existance. I could never get HTML elements to do what I wanted them to. I despised having to make CSS styles for the projects I worked on. I'm not a designer, so I don't know what looks good. If I could leave my web applications in a 1990s era design I would, but that's not acceptable anymore.

Eventually, I learned about the CSS framework Bootstrap and I instantly loved using it. It accomplished everything that I couldn't do with CSS by myself. Using CSS by itself infuriated me and Bootstrap relieved all of it. I don't have to worry that much about making my web applications being readable on mobile devices as Bootstrap handles everything for me. I no longer have to figure out how to design something with CSS and what looks good as Bootstrap has components that already have great designs and all look great. It was very simple to learn and the documentation is extremely well made, I could always find what I wanted to do.

After having a wonderful time with Bootstrap, I never thought I would learn another CSS framework again. Then Semantic UI came and everything went off the rails. At first I was open minded to Semantic, then the downfall happened. At first when I was looking through the documentation it took me a little bit to find out where the HTML for the components were. I used inspect element in order to figure it out, but that's not the most optimal thing to use as It's hard to copy paste it into your project to use. Then I saw the <>'s, I wish they were more prominent on the page so I could've found them at first glance. Since I knew Bootstrap before Semantic I heavily favored Bootstrap's class names compared to Semantic. There's just something with Semantic's classes that I just don't like, I can't put my finger on it, maybe I'm just too biased toward Bootstrap.

Overall, CSS frameworks solves a lot of headaches for people that aren't designers. Having things that just work out of the box makes things a whole lot easier, rather than reinventing the wheel every time. I still favor Bootstrap over Semantic, but I can live with it. As long as I don't have to write a web application's CSS from scratch.
