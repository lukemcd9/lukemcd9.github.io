When I was hired to work at Enterprise Systems as a Java Web Programmer the first project that my coworkers and I were assigned to was a simple introductory [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) web application called the Holiday web service. It's a relatively small application that shows what holidays there are in a selected year and what type of holiday they are, example: Federal, State, UH, and Bank holidays. The Holidays app is mainly used internally, but this helped us learn the basics of web applications with Spring Boot. We also had a glimpse of what it's like to work in an enterprise setting where there would be weekly meetings discussing what we worked on. We were introduced to [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) the issue tracking software which is what we would check for seeing what tasks there are to do. Also unit testing with [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/) which at first I wondered why we had to use it, but after using it I understood that actually making sure that your logic works correctly rather than assuming it is correct saves time and headaches.

Our tasks were making improvements to the user interface of the application like highlighting the next holiday that is coming up by using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). Adding more information for what type of holiday it is. Improvements to the REST API that internal apps use for getting holidays. Overall, I thought this app was a great starting point in learning web development with Spring Boot and how software development at the enterprise level is like.
